        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>My full name is Michelle Rose Tse (I prefer to go by Rose). 
          When I was younger, I wanted to become a physician, so once I entered university, I was pre-med. However, I heard that learning how to code 
          is useful, so I decided to be pre-med and major in Computer Science. After having several opportunities to experience life as a physician by shadowing various 
          doctors (e.g., orthopedic surgeons, plastic and reconstructive surgeons, pediatricians, opthalmologists) while in school, I decided that career path is not 
          for me. Rather, I became more interested in the intersection of technology and medicine/healthcare. As such, between my junior and senior year of college, I 
          was a Machine Learning Intern at the Sandia National Laboratories, mostly focused on gathering, extracting and formatting data to be fed into models/classifiers. 
          After graduation (I completed my Computer Science B.S. program in around 3.5 years), I was not exactly sure where to go or what to do: I just knew I would like to 
          be in the tech sphere, preferrably in the healthcare/medical field. Hence, I accepted my current IT position at Stanford Health Care (SHC). After working at 
          SHC for nearly a year, I've decided I would like to go into data analytics. I really enjoy working with data and visualizing it.

          I recently learned how to use Tableau and have a <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/michelle.rose.tse#!/vizhome/">public profile</a>.

          Here is the <a href="images/biofuel.pdf">poster presentation</a> I made midway through my internship at the Sandia National Labs.
